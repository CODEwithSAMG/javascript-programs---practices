Ques: Multiply each element by 2 and return only those elements which are greater than 10?

// map method with filter method together they called chaining methods

let arr = [2,3,4,6,8];
let myArr = arr.map((curElem)=>{
    return curElem*2
}).filter((curElem)=>{
    console.log(curElem, "after performing map method")
    return curElem>10
})

console.log(myArr)




output: 

4
6
8
12
16
[ 12, 16 ]
